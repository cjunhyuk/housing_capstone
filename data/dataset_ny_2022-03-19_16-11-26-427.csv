The sun-flooded rooms of this twelve-into-ten room residence, with multiple corner exposures, are perfectly suited for grand and gracious entertaining as well as quiet and cozy family living.

Accessed by a private elevator vestibule, the gracious rectangular Gallery with its grand staircase opens to an elegantly proportioned corner Living Room and an intimate wood-paneled Library with powder room, both of which boast wood-burning fireplaces. The public portion of the home also features a grand formal Dining Room facing North towards the famed 740 Park cooperative. The bright and cheerful eat-in kitchen, which overlooks 71st Street, is replete with top-of-the-line appliances including a vented Wolf range and hood, two Miele dishwashers, a Thermador oven and microwave, a well-proportioned center island, and an abundance of pantry and storage space. Rounding out the lower floor of the duplex are staff rooms transformed into Laundry and Playrooms as well as a functional full bath and two clothes dryers (condenser units) on each floor.

The private quarters located on the 8th floor, accessed by a beautiful arching staircase atop of which is hidden a discretely placed mini-bar, include a very generous corner Primary Bedroom, an enlarged Primary Bath with Waterworks fixtures and a very spacious Walk-in Closet and Dressing Room. There are two additional bedrooms with dedicated baths and ample closet space. Finally, the fourth bedroom is an oversized Guest Room with a walk-in closet and ensuite bath with double vanity and Waterworks fixtures - easily considered a second Primary Bedroom given its size and appointment. 

Additional features of this elegant home include Sonos speakers in the Kitchen, Living Room, Dining Room, Den, and Master Bedroom, FIOS with in-wall wiring, multipoint concealed WiFi, and lite touch central lighting system. PTAC air is in each room, with the exception of the kitchen which has a larger A/C unit, and a large storage cage conveys with the apartment. With 32 windows all looking out over Lenox Hill's most coveted location, this stylish and delightful residence is in mint and move-in condition.

This sought-after prewar full-service cooperative is superbly located in one of Manhattan's most desirable residential areas on the west side of Park Avenue at the corner of 71st Street. The distinguished and impeccably staffed building provides its tenant shareholders with a private gym and storage areas as well as a meticulous in-residence superintendent. 3% Flip Tax Paid by Buyer.

Living just blocks away from Prospect Park gives you unlimited access to all of what the park has to offer: Prospect Park Bandshell, Smorgasburg, the LeFrak Center, Prospect Park Carousel, Drummers Cove, the Prospect Park Zoo, Lefferts Historic House, and the Brooklyn Botanical Garden just to name a few!

Enjoy other Parks and Greeneries such as Grand Army Plaza, Joseph Mayrose Park, Butterfly Gardens, Green space on 4th, and 6 15 Green.

Enjoy local attractions such as Brooklyn Glass, Gallery Players Theater, Greenwood Park Beer Garden, New York Sports Club, The End is Near, and Union Market. Local restaurants and bars include Giovanni's Brooklyn Eats, Black Horse Pub, Sea Witch, and Terrace Bagels.

South Slope/Greenwood also includes dozens of bike paths for easy travel.

"Watertown",,,"NY","418 Broadway Ave E",,"13601","4","6","USD","Real estate investing has stood the test of time. There are a lot of options here. Great rental history and all three apartments are currently rented. Apartment 1 is a spacious, 2 level apartment with 3 to 4 bedrooms. Part of the apartment is being utilized as a massage business with  a waiting room and a therapy room, still leaving plenty of room for the tenants!  The current tenant is the seller's daughter so she is enjoying a reduced rent of $900 a month. This would be a great owner occupied apartment. Unit 2 is on the first floor and has plenty of windows to let the light shine in. Unit 3, a second floor apartment has a long term tenant. The time is right to invest in your future and be part of a quaint village along the shores of the St. Lawrence River. Walk across the street to the village green and enjoy the summer festivals and concerts. Walk to public access points to the river and spend your days swimming or just relaxing by the water.

There are truly 15 lots, one being made up of a massive pond for the next owner(s) to fish, boat, and enjoy. The owner also completed a high quality road design that wraps around the inner circumference of the 14 lots with excellent grading and run-off, where each driveway would commence. The road, engineering, permitting, grading, and other related costs were nearly $750,000. The owner will, at his expense, move his current luxury home, to one directly on south street, setting the stage for the next owner to start developing with a blank canvas. Once moved, the luxury home and property on south street could be available for purchase. Other than its proximity to the mountain, price, and dynamic terrain, the development is highly accessible to the sewer district, a MAJOR added value. The sewer allows the next developer multiple options, pending local approval. The opportunity allows the next owner to leave the subdivision as it is now, designed for low density private luxury homes, service a high volume of condos or townhomes, or, a unique one family stunning 15.25 acres family compound. The development has a private road entrance from south street, and an access road coming from the east, allowing a quick walk or drive to the slopes and base lodge. The 15.25 acres is comprised of 60% deciduous trees, meadows and fields, all gently sloping upward. Take in the resorts recreation and entertainment throughout the year--skiing, snowboarding, mountain biking, golfing, and special events, as alpine regions in America have recently been seen as safe-havens, protection, and solid long-term investment opportunities. What is majorly lacking is inventory! Any real estate asset proximate to a popular alpine resort is a solid long-term investment, most of them with their own large scale development plans, according to various nationally recognized real estate analytic firms. They are fascinated by what is now known as ""The Great Reshuffling."" With new virtual work policies, a spike in short term rentals that experts say does not plan on slowing down any time soon, as well as novel new prop-tech financing business models, this property is truly the last of its kind. Windham is uniquely positioned to be a power player in the alpine real estate and development sector in the coming years and it is just over 2 hours from Manhattan.","FOR_SALE","42.301937","644","-74.25034","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8db13c2ab25992c935cf229cfdc12385-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cf070c9c3fb7d8c3c66f5144005c11e4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c735ece85c4a31e8e8cd82b365bb7055-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8ba1c65f69bd685e9b8513fc5ae9099e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/58fff6f05c27adededb2b498d760fcca-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7b59ece5fade8ba32da9aa46008db581-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1a6b6e5d23ca8c06a75051975551f8ea-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/74ce27bb834ec57f7e15d3d8d4989597-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e46b58bfe43b7f97fded4539ee850c0f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/bac32a424f10c066b96351d60b2998e1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a6f86ac9af265bbf8ffc976cbc06505f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/df02870df21ff688b5afb310d546faa6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/67e1401de12036f23e46a9736e3273c2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3850fc39eaa1128a14d473f0b3485b22-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/64c7d9a7f79d5d29340f32a233e7d736-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3ab79fbbf461f5eb6739737a877e3e3f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8e1f2257f22ece6f3453531285c03b07-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ff2ac6278f8cfc5852807faf4224abb9-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3cdbf472d20c5bca9d7706a1fdb8716d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1e7a0593c5935c7e2fd2dd5cf6835c17-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4e7ae13469aa11fa042423ad93aa2707-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1d5e662a81762420689b089a57c19118-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4b95e71f288776332a30e2db95217f4c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ee0356a12301eef4641eb8024af1522a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d6d3b8b2b45caf6b18d050dd9cafbddf-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/df03bcb9ff5f0f8ada9e9b024c4223cb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ccadaeb2741345992bc7adb4d251b41b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b3257a7956bde6425da18435ab2b4b81-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6da7928cce3f0b53ca650d995ced566b-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"4950000","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/21-Lakeview-Dr-Windham-NY-12496/215855774_zpid/","1970"

MEMORIAL DAY TO LABOR DAY Preferred, beyond negotiable.
Renovated in 2021, this charming cottage just outside of Woodstock captures both a sense of calm and views across the Ashokan Reservoir.
A covered carport greets you as you enter through the pink door into the large living / dining room. The stone fireplace warms the house, along with a new gas furnace that provides both AC and ducted heat throughout. An antique Parisian zinc bar is the cornerstone of the room from which to admire the views, or watch the 55"" Samsung/ cable TV. 
The kitchen is a cooks paradise featuring Viking and Fisher Paykel appliances including double dishwashers, 4-door fridge/freezer and electric composter. Completing this level is a Queen size bedroom with Rolandelectric piano and study desk, next to a full bathroom. 

The fully carpeted top floor has a massive high beamed ceiling, King size bed with separate dressing area. The ensuite bathroom has whimsical wallpaper and a follow-on stunning view of the reservoir while you bathe. The bedroom includes a Samsung TV with Spectrum cable, individual AC/heat system, ceiling fan and 'Mirror' subscription for daily exercise.

 A second kitchen on the lower level serves as both a Summer kitchen for easy outdoor access and a laundry with large Speed Queen washer and dryer.The original stone walls provide a cool Summer space in which to eat-in, study at the desk, watch television, and utilize as a third bedroom with the double sofa-bed. 
The stone patio includes a Char-Broil grill, umbrella covered table & chairs, hammock and white metal chairs and stone table. Back up towards the carport is a stone firepit and second shade covered hammock. 
When you are ready to take a swim the forty-foot long concrete pool can be heated with the new Hayward gas system. A deep end for diving in or a large shallow end for water aerobics and kids games. Chaise lounge furniture sits alongside another table setting. The adjacent pool house offers a half bath (toilet and sink) and holds all the towels and fun pool toys you will need for a wonderful summer vacation.

It has a cistern well water system because a water line has yet to be installed on this road. It's located in a beautiful country surrounded area with rolling hills, fields and wooded areas. It's very peaceful and absolutely beautiful. My father left me this house and I want to sell it. I love in Oregon so I can't do much with it other than sell. I want to sell it to you! Please contact me via email or text. It's hard for me to talk on the phone because of my work schedule but I will make time if you are seriously interested. My email is johnkuzzie35@gmail.com and my number is 541-913-8986
One final thing is that I have to still put my father's will through probate in the court and times have been very hard for me financially so I am still trying to save up the money to do that so i can have the deed switched to my name. I have everything I need including his will which states that the house belongs to me once he passes. I'm trying to get that taken care of but I wanted to put that out there to make sure you know what exactly is going on. Thanks again.

Just north of Minerva, NY sits a “slice” of heaven! Minerva is considered an Adirondack town because it is nestled between the famous mountains and is mostly state land. The heavily wooded area provides privacy and protection as well as a colorful change of seasons and maple syrup tours! The proximity to Minerva Lake and Lake George bring outdoor enthusiasts from all over the state to hunt, fish, camp, hike, and enjoy water sports. Whitewater rafting with the many area outfitters and cave spelunking at the Natural Stone Bridge and Caves are popular outings.

The images won’t do justice to the absolutely INCREDIBLE views this land has to offer.

Sitting on your private secluded mountain top with views for miles of the adirondacks.

These 36 acres consist of two lots. One 17.69 acres and the other about 19.29. I will only be selling them together.

I already went ahead and did the septic design for both lots in addition blue prints and CAD design for a house I was about to start building. 

I am looking to move out of the state. 

I will be more than happy to answer any questions you might have. 

The views alone are the reason I purchased this. This will go fast!

Build two homes. Make them airbnb’s, weekend getaways or come live in this beautiful paradise.

"Millerton",,,"NY","Boston Corners Rd",,"12546","0","2","USD","53.39 acres located in a fertile valley adjacent to the Taconic Mountains in a hamlet called Boston Corners. 

Geographically the property sits at the literal intersection of three states; New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, and three wonderful regions; the Hudson Valley, the Berkshires, and the rolling hills of northeast Connecticut. Historically, the property is located in one of the most interesting parts of New York State, if not the country with roots dating back to the early colonel era.  Agriculturally it has been farmed for hundreds of years and continues to be farmed by local farmers. The topography of the property is flat with deep soil.  Water is plentiful and flows down the Taconic Mountains into nearby streams and lakes. Ecologically the property is diverse with grassland birds and butterflies which frequent its meadows and beavers that manage a waterway that runs through the back. Aesthetically the property is a pastoral paradise; a romanized version of the country made true — framed by mountains and farmland. 

Presently, this property has a driveway and building site approved with septic. It also has acreage in agricultural production, in collaboration with a local farmer, as well as pasture and wilderness. Ultimately this property can be subdivided into as many as 10 lots and or kept as a single parcel for a single residence. It has low taxes and flexible building codes, lots of privacy, and state land across the street, which leads up into the Taconic mountains.  

As an investment, the property is a great deal and is presently being offered for $350,000. That’s $6,555 an acre which is lower than any other property in the area. The land is located in an incredibly desirable area with real estate prices on a steady rise and quality land becoming increasingly scarce.

Super nice house on quiet private road. Handful of neighbors and half are residents the other half are summer homes. This house has summer homes on each side. Quiet and cozy year round. 
Remember ‘zestimates’ are inaccurate and do not determine appraised value of a property. If you look these are based on non-comparable home sales most not even on the lake and sold in older markets up to 2-3 years ago. This is why you see smaller, older and outdated homes in need of major work on smaller lots with a zestimate twice that of this particular property. This is not reliable source for determining a homes value. With over 20 years in real estate I can positively assure you of that as will any real estate broker.

"Hunt",,,"NY","Portageville Rd LOT WP001",,"14846","0",,"USD","Whitetail Properties is pleased to present an amazing opportunity to own a piece of American civil war history. Bordering the ""Grand Canyon of the East"" - Letchworth state park, this property was once the site of the famous Cascade hotel and the original east entrance to the Portage bridge that spanned the Genesee river that majestically roars through the award-winning park. Letchworth State Park was voted the #1 state park in 2015 of over 6000 parks across the country. Further was also voted best attraction in New York state in 2017. The bridge originally required over 300 acres of timber to construct. At the time, it was the longest and tallest wooden bridge in the world, but today has been replaced with a modern steel bridge to connect the east and west sides over the upper falls. This property was the landing site for material for the new bridge, and today has views of the bridge and a look over the upper waterfalls where mist rises in the fall color. The property is wrapped by over 70% borderland with Letchworth State Park for a distance of 8/10'ths of a mile as neighboring property. Inside the park, frequenting visitors would recognize the War memorial that celebrates the First New York Dragoons that trained in Portageville on the parade grounds and shipped off to war to famous battles from the train depot next to the Cascade hotel. They mustered out June 30th, 1865, from here. Most interesting is the original foundation stone for the memorial are on the property to visit. The memorial once called this property its home until it was moved into the park in 1917. Over the years, the owners have found civil war-era artifacts of whisky bottles, lockets, arrows heads, Indian jewelry, etc. They are physical mementos and connections to the past days of a special time in history. The Parade grounds where the troops had trained and staged is at the bottom of the hill, only a mere 1.2 miles away. The Portageville Park Entrance is only 1 mile from the property and is the southwest entrance to the park. The property also is the highest ground on the southeast corner of the park area at 1320 feet, where local balloon rides float by overhead as they tour the falls and park features from above. In more modern times, the popular Finger Lakes trail was established and also wraps the property for those of the hiking spirit. All creatures great and small call this property home. Deer, Turkey, Bear, and even a nesting pair of Bald Eagles are frequently observed on the property. A 2200 sqft home sits on the property that is 75% completed and is located on the bluff edge on the southern border. This could be completed with little work and time or converted into a welcome center for a commercial opportunity. With The way the property is oriented, there is an opportunity to commercially enhance the upper pasture into a campground, RV park, a housing development, or retirement village with premium lots overlooking the southeast bluffs and northwest park border. Trails are established through the woods for access to all corners of the property, and further commercial opportunities present themself for lower development at the base of the bluff.

Well-maintained, freshly painted, move-in ready ranch in a quiet, friendly neighborhood 5 minutes from SUNY New Paltz, downtown New Paltz restaurants and shops, and some of the best hiking trails and scenic views in the Hudson Valley. Easy access to New York City, by bus, train, or car (a 90-minute drive to Manhattan during non-peak hours). This three-bedroom house features a large kitchen, a stunning backyard bordered by mature plantings and trees, a light-filled sun room with a vaulted ceiling, and a two-car garage. A brand new roof was installed last spring (May 2021) by Klaus Larsen, which has an impressive 50-year warranty, and ventilation expanded in the attic to moderate temperature and humidity.

Brand new skylights have been added in the breathtaking floor-to-ceiling windowed sun room, with a vaulted ceiling and views of nature in three directions. (Four if you include the skylights!) Equipped with cordless bamboo shades and custom matching skylight shades on every window to keep light in or heat out, the sun room features a sliding door which opens onto an original blue stone patio. Both patio and sun room face the enormous backyard, bordered in the back by tall trees so that the property feels both spacious and secluded. The half-acre property includes two raised gardening beds, a fire pit, and a post perfectly situated for hanging a hammock. Botanical features include lilac bushes, a Japanese maple tree, a magnolia tree, and an array of other perennial trees and wildflowers.

The primary bedroom of the house fits a king-size bed with room to spare. The original hardwood floors go throughout the main house and are freshly finished. The kitchen—well-equipped for the serious cook—is outfitted with stainless steel appliances: a new Samsung induction range, a professional quality Hauslane vented range hood, and a Bosch dishwasher. Also updated: the furnace-integrated water heater and water piping throughout the house.

A dedicated laundry room includes a utility sink and basement-level drain pump. The basement also features a well-maintained well water purification system, oil heating system, and an early 1900s woodworking bench. The two-car garage has access to the stunning backyard.","FOR_SALE","41.716717","1291","-74.08408","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6429d85e6eaa4fc9002b03c0b20c2772-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b10f59c54f8186c3d2c7351f66658baf-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/66aeb7f1f8e46b926adf0e57077e2ae4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c394bfac2dd0194e92767b20024b621e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/57a1b836b38b6cdb05b2e70d5cb9e8bd-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5f55faf1dd8ffd1daaf9a0e55f2c718c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/013b6a6d8c20a79074e37f1f8b52892d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d4fac162d7b8af08a53e2abe603aac72-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c4400c246764746ffdda2d254a14559e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/49a0cf71126d3612f79e68798d7f3d3d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/204818e13db3e68202c783569c48b6e1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1dca54cac92d22c2af28a15924b63177-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/62675b2971db970f317b31e081fa378d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2ca0f2a82d4142bd8096ae06f3c3b70a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7f4f5e33cfa187738050e1af47a1e199-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/eb686f5ef6264898760e98263e2db37e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/eff579f487364a25e44343c2cbbd216b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d5f4f480002d78793ca8a501ca9538a4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b45a866fc5d4af58e4334a03e1162651-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d86afec1a5c81c79da917d5350cd1b5a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8d60834b06973c87a69d0b8a696537f9-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/876cd6e22a55581fb212891f60703348-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9d940b3092854f9eebbc280ebcb72a43-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7638c928e80dbb56d286f92cc2b49df8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ff7a400f7a44ec6e24f141b125fdc3be-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/93d91181c2e6e515b233a5198dc7a2e4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/28170179cd507198431904c1aa452b32-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"360000","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/228-State-Route-32-S-New-Paltz-NY-12561/2084467418_zpid/","1956"

"Corfu",,,"NY","1 Allegheny St LOT WP001",,"14036","0",,"USD","Attention investors and developers. Here is an opportunity to develop a property on some of the last acreage available in a large parcel on the I-90 interstate at Exit 48-A, Pembroke/Akron/Corfu. This exit is the main onboard and offboard for commuters to the towns between Buffalo and Batavia, and Rochester. It is the main artery connecting the 1.5 million annual visitors to the famous Six Flags Darien Lake Amusement Park, and all of the towns north and south of the I-90 between the cities as well. What makes this property so unique and strategically located is it is right across the road on CR 77 from the newly announced groundbreaking of the Department of Veterans Affairs Western New York National cemetery. The new national cemetery will serve the burial needs of more than 96,000 Veterans for the next 70 years and will be the seventh VA national cemetery in the state of New York. However, this interstate exchange is currently underserved with commercial opportunities for hotels, fast food restaurants, convenience stores, travel plazas, etc. For the next 70 plus years, families, dignitaries, tourists, and others will visit the cemetery with each guest needing lodging, conveniences, food, and services. This is your opportunity! Literally only 325 feet from the westbound lane of the I-90, and a couple of hundred yards from the I-90 on and off-ramp the proximity of this parcel is brilliant. If you are considering a distribution center location, the property is merely 15 miles east of Buffalo, and 40 miles west of Rochester. Of course, the I-90 corridor can connect your business to destinations well beyond Genesee county and the state line. The Town of Pembroke has already identified this property as part of the Interstate Interchange (INT) District for zoning. According to the published zoning guide: The property is approved for the following commercial opportunities (Beginning page 42) SECTION 408 INTERCHANGE DISTRICT- INT The Interchange (INT) District is designed to blend commercial and light industrial uses, thus maximizing the development potential of the NYS Thruway Interchange.

"Rye",,,"NY","315 Brevoort Ln",,"10580","9","11","USD","""The Anchorage ""
A rare opportunity to own one of the largest waterfront properties in Rye. 5.9  pastoral acres and 4.4 underwater acres totaling 10.3 acres. A premier coastal estate with an historic home sited upon high elevation with endless views of the Long Island Sound. Formerly owned by the President of Paramount Pictures, the Anchorage was used as the secret filming location for ""Sabrina"" with Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. Its secluded waterfront is featured in the opening and sailing scenes.

A magnificent brick Georgian Colonial designed by the distinguished architect Mott B.Schmidt,  Multileveled brick terraces were designed by renowned landscape architect Ellen Biddle Shipman. A broad rolling lawn, framed by mature tulip and beech trees, slopes down to a semicircular sea wall enveloping a private sandy beach. The view is sublime throughout every season. 
   An architectural masterpiece with eight fireplaces, six bedrooms, three maid's rooms, a third-floor bedroom/ exercise room, mother-in-law’s suite, and beautiful views from every window. The building’s construction is of the highest quality, with red brick and white trim and thick interior plaster walls.
The Anchorage was the paradigm for Mott Schmidt’s long and distinguished career. “ Mott Schmidt created many sumptuous residences in his trademark American Georgian style for the city’s society and business elite,” stated architect Robert A. M. Stern.” As the master of proportion, Schmidt’s brilliance is seen in the graceful, restrained restatement of the American Georgian vocabulary.
   Classical simplicity is achieved in the formal entry hall with classical architectural details accented by Schmidt’s signature elegant curving staircase.  The living and dining room have oak parquet floors and a wall of French doors opening out towards the Sound. 
   A European-imported paneled library with magnificent wood carving.  A breakfast room overlooks an in-ground pool and garden terrace. The garden room overlooks the West lawn and  Van Amringe Pond.  You will never want to leave this tranquil oasis.

The historic estate includes an 1850 ‘s carriage house/barn, cottage, and 750 sq ft boathouse/artist studio. (Selling as is). 
A 40-minute commute to Grand Central and a 1/2 hour drive to Manhattan. Close to public and private schools. Numerous golf and yacht clubs are nearby.

"Corfu",,,"NY","3 Allegheny St LOT WP003",,"14036","0",,"USD","Attention investors and developers. Here is an opportunity to develop a property on some of the last acreage available in a large parcel on the I-90 interstate at Exit 48-A, Pembroke/Akron/Corfu. This exit is the main onboard and offboard for commuters to the towns between Buffalo and Batavia, and Rochester. It is the main artery connecting the 1.5 million annual visitors to the famous Six Flags Darien Lake amusement park, and all of the towns north and south of the I-90 between the cities as well. What makes this property so unique and strategically located is it is right across the road on CR 77 from the newly announced groundbreaking of the Department of Veterans Affairs Western New York National cemetery. The new national cemetery will serve the burial needs of more than 96,000 Veterans for the next 70 years and will be the seventh VA national cemetery in the state of New York. However, this interstate exchange is currently underserved with commercial opportunities for hotels, fast food restaurants, convenience stores, travel plazas, etc. For the next 70 plus years, families, dignitaries, tourists, and others will visit the cemetery with each guest needing lodging, conveniences, food, and services. This is your opportunity! Literally only 325 feet from the westbound lane of the I-90, and a couple of hundred yards from the I-90 on and off-ramp the proximity of this parcel is brilliant. If you are considering a distribution center location, the property is merely 15 miles east of Buffalo, and 40 miles west of Rochester. Of course, the I-90 corridor can connect your business to destinations well beyond Genesee county and the state line. The Town of Pembroke has already identified this property as part of the Interstate Interchange (INT) District for zoning. According to the published zoning guide: The property is approved for the following commercial opportunities (Beginning page 42) SECTION 408 INTERCHANGE DISTRICT- INT The Interchange (INT) District is designed to blend commercial and light industrial uses, thus maximizing the development potential of the NYS Thruway Interchange.
