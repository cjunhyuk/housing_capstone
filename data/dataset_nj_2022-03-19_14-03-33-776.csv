When, in Randolph, can you find almost 2 flat acres of property with a custom colonial home that has enough space and flexibility for an In-Law Suite conversion, and a 2 bay HEATED outbuilding with 2 oversized overhead doors?!! Centrally located within Center Grove, this home is minutes from Routes 10, 46, 53, 202, 80, and 287.

"Princeton",,,"NJ","35 Sergeant St",,"08540","3","3","USD","With the eye of an artist and the experience of a designer, the intrepid owner of this in-town end-unit embarked on a transformation that successfully modernized every level. She then channeled her energy to the outdoors and, with the help of in-demand master gardener Ronni Hock, created a wraparound oasis of greenery and blooms that can be enjoyed from the enclosed stone patio and while inside through vast panes of glass and Kolbe sliders. Every little detail was mulled over and it shows! A new bar in the living room is lacquered to a high shine, custom lucite handrails line the stairs and a hand-blown Czech glass and rope fixture lights up the landing. Even the interiors of appliances were specially chosen for their obsidian black finish. The slick kitchen is certainly not just for show. It works hard with a retractable hood over the induction cooktop, pop-up outlets and durable porcelain waterfalling over an island concealing secret wine drawers. Bathroom accents are especially style-forward, like lizard skin-textured tile in the powder room and underlighting in the just completed main bath. The hall bath is also brand new with a chic, brass-edged vanity and bold concrete tiles. Bedroom one has a California Closets system. Bedroom two has a built-in desk by CC, and the brilliantly sunny main suite takes it up a notch with a walk-in closet designed by Rachel Webster. Even the storage room and 2-car garage are clean as can be. A mod and smartly designed laundry/mudroom is the perfect place to hang your coat. Truly a flawless and functional work of art! Owner is NJ Licensed Real Estate Agent.","FOR_SALE","40.354332","0","-74.64286","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1edb67b46ea6fa72c7ba314c46e5ce3b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0dd95c36662b247c9e5a66df7d81def5-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c147fc906426477cc81bf96ed4a53eaa-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ecad54b06d43065228fc6f7955666a3a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0f5d3893f41c8c3bd1c1aa28e1cc0372-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/56a6de06360641df8d8692842eff6625-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3b9ffe9d283c99f8b188ce7709c55561-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/da2828ffabab1a2598b880696b96538d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d5bed53aa7da93e28ecd1eff3940e45a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8e9d40189f113e4ad5cebe2faeee1026-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/178c1d762acdda5df39c57b78699fb8d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d75317e8d16b7ecc2413afe83ba7eadc-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2f28c915b58310a3f4b9757fe6b4bbe7-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a9033e074e3354790c89be9e4ecc051f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/40bff1387110de6c491706d2b9764242-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1004f2f2b13c823e36f9564db9f077dc-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c6964cc17d33cc046a9414624e51b251-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f6f72bc2a8ac4cfe9a530490db71b1c0-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8552ab982480e1ea4d0b5d17f92511d6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/74050b682cf46215446484964c114002-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b3286c08233e6094c32b883bc4a1a82e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/dce166f99b3b7d1b9ab3ad5e553ad15e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/58512cab392c2a0286aca74f88884158-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/eec3e1e6a9676f53f6f97ebe279f2466-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4bc34818c3ab2a76b1da4653c61b69e1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/eac775a046b276957695fc8fee66272a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b804317702806904d4f61ee98973442b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6e1c59b52decad5f2915d448badff1f9-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5ba539b41bff762a21281bed4745ab3c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cec7d519b0fa885f7bae4479b985ae61-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d17674badf7d83da9d828cda47d57422-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/507735a3b2afe470b4225ee91449d4f7-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/003894a1e811e755a285b34c82164c79-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/bc5c3f94e1e33092a70d66785f81ce15-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/737b1e17b08f489260e05445b53ce40f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/072a6f026bf0955a6b5fbde71aea1ac9-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a13867cae6317c4be1f041626596e35b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/63dcb9152a2906653b2cc5b3e37c509d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9dceda0831640322ab38c76e77f0e5b6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7c43a9d0b1e3e28223c6b6c529b49e7b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/295e0fceb67b28b1f3dfe6963b7e057f-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1350000","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/35-Sergeant-St-Princeton-NJ-08540/39008987_zpid/","1984"

"Somers Pt",,,"NJ","698 W Maryland Ave",,"08244","2","4","USD","Great opportunity for this large 2100 sq ft home in a nice location of Somers Point. Offering 4 beds 2 full baths - 3 bedrooms and 1 full bath on 2nd floor, and 1 bedroom and full bath in full basement. Rather unique layout but it does provide ample space for a growing family. Large Living room with wood burning fireplace, dining room, and large eat-in kitchen. The basement does provide an additional living room/family room; or, it can be entirely used as a large in-law set up, or convert it into a large master room suite.

"Gladstone",,,"NJ","10 Jackson Ave",,"07934","3","4","USD","Custom-built in the late 1800s for John Bodine, 10 Jackson Avenue is a historic home located in the heart of Gladstone. Bodine was a master builder and the town's mayor; the home is sited on land sub-divided from the property next door which was owned by his aunts.

 After Bodine moved, the home had several owners including Tim Hildebrandt, a famous illustrator who was best known for the early Star Wars movie posters. Hildebrandt left his mark on the home in several ways: a mural he painted in one of the bedrooms, a movie using the home as a backdrop, and several children's books with illustrations of the home. 

In recent years, the home had fallen into disrepair until the current owner purchased the property in 2019. With its high ceilings, deep baseboards, gracious primary rooms, gleaming wood floors throughout and extensive millwork, this home has been restored to its former grandeur. Great care was taken to install antique doors and hardware in keeping with the home's 19th century aesthetic. Additionally, all the original hardware, knobs and back plates throughout the house were painstakingly cleaned and polished. 

Original double doors on the wraparound porch open to a foyer featuring an ornate stairwell detailed with a stained glass window and board and batten millwork. The formal living room is on the left, where original pocket doors separate it from the dining room. A bay window, door to the porch, chair rails, deep baseboards and built-in cabinets are featured in the dining room. The family room has the high original tin ceiling, plus access to a private renovated side porch and updated powder room.

Totally renovated in 2019, the gourmet kitchen contains Wood-Mode cabinetry, Carrera marble countertops, beveled edge subway tiles, white pine flooring, a French farm sink, Italian convection gas stove and a custom exhaust hood. 

All the materials used on the second story were carefully selected to be in keeping with the home's vintage character. This level has high ceilings, three bedrooms and two new baths. A hall leads to the charming upper porch and a rear staircase to the kitchen.

The third floor offers great versatile living space; two bedrooms and a common gathering area provide lots of additional square footage. In keeping with a Victorian home built in this era, the third floor features a turret and interesting ceiling lines.

Outside, a newly-expanded deck features stairs to an antique garden gate revealing a lush yard with beautiful perennial plants and flowering trees. The original barn is there too-- it is the last part of this remarkable property waiting for the future owner's special touch.","FOR_SALE","40.724586","3200","-74.66712","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/378b7956e294dfee46299f349bc05b40-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/49a5ee3a209d0f287abd81d2bd2f3beb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/26a2843612ec358d41ad0fef3ac5b402-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2dafd5dbb51c712b94c3935389bbfb12-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ca18d6b9c8f2af05ca83cc2ff0c1280a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/aede7be0657180f0ab63a1757d9ce99c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c2a1b8497215d9c9916958f84c782df7-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1a90b70748f0e6e22713c316dc2005b4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9e96e4aad7cc82ae7cf5c3fd211a3ae4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ed3127ad1b0aa996a8d8215618b79f8f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ef956a6add181c7f9d4b0b8bb7cbfc44-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d8be8faad2010750e59d9f63f3566a67-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d7ab5bde9e9517de54c20ab34541b190-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3df8e28195f1f43a208647c8bcf3fd8d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/295caaa8b5fd34f37ed53fe798fd5b12-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/07891665b05a5161a60de3091582104b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b042e4da26f40421515c9158fe4aeb2b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4a6c66bdbe5a06689ddeb404f399c19c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4d9f668b2ebfdbfebb67b105709ba26f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3dce1681a3efed4fb8b2c5a6523b0625-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/77addd6dd472c2be73f221f1a774697d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0af4ac34010a5e63c135b89a1e691ada-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3ad8c83ab3c686eb603c9d04040b790c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/bb48f87105cc1161c1f09bab88b9896e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ea879e995a43775b0882980855db0709-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1acdefe8d09fadcd7369ffdcc06a5331-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/360f83cc5116c1476a1415b64a1b83c9-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/69c7681619f965fd1197ac3c41a02704-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a4067c0476996fa14020e7fb6057c9e1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/135f08d764cd08a7622f82947fd4d05a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1a5eb12c97bffb59fb2839101bfc1b1e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2ee44b15b5c61b1b63c6ec2e8adef7a8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a8542329c1da86c6a2c39185e877f810-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1100000","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/10-Jackson-Ave-Gladstone-NJ-07934/39909332_zpid/","1895"

This is a rare opportunity to own a fully renovated modern condo with a 170-degrees view at the center of Edgewater.","FOR_SALE","40.83293","1200","-73.972885","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e4de2a6bdebbe9cc7c86d87148592d31-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a1211f2feeba79bd9fa1c84c12a41bba-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/249fd28dd77d1afe8be3735a6aefa6ca-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5c2d692171fa03b02457eeb92bf8f800-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/215b87f187c2e3ddeb66ebbb50925d02-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8932d8defe14a919547b1ef8ed8eca7a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e04eead9c0a2771ffed16d25e3d76c51-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/72e6ebec9e5d90de731ec07d0550eca8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d49567a0af00566511147bb25256bf59-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b6fbb3dbabb713011653bdbcb6e668d3-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/86f189ed171584da158ebeafcb72c00e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f9b0e106ff715bdddb635f30c35eed9b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/098b0844d9e5cbb54131fa77ca391900-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/19493bb0c91a24294ff115d40c64e731-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b3a49e836e9c9cb8252ed199279daf58-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/69074a53fb498511085ebd1b1dc02cb1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5816b8f409e372eeb9892a5ef107dade-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/438cc431684d0f2d90833823b5e678e6-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"580000","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/101-Route-5-204-Edgewater-NJ-07020/2065566035_zpid/","1982"

"Tewksbury Township",,,"NJ","56 Bissell Rd",,"08833","8","5","USD","Architecturally-Nuanced Shingle Style Residence 

A modern example of Shingle-style architecture is surrounded by 3.8+/- acres of scenic countryside in Tewksbury Township. Elaborately detailed and generously proportioned, this 7,377 square-foot home arranged on four finished levels features five bedrooms, five full baths, three powder rooms, a four-level elevator and an attached four-car garage. Striking distant views are captured throughout the interior as well as a huge rear deck, covered front porches, paver patio with fountain and private front balcony serving the primary suite.

High levels of design and craftsmanship are evident in the layout's Brazilian cherry, limestone, tile and marble floors, four ornately mantled fireplaces, detailed moldings, coffered ceilings and arched room openings. A variety of Smart Home technology features, a Creston audio system and generator are additional conveniences. Set deep into its tranquil acreage and approached by a long paved drive, this expansive home is minutes from the charming village of Oldwick, Interstate 78, golf clubs, shops, dining and nature preserves. 

Introducing the flowing floor plan is a two-story foyer designed with custom tile flooring, a turned staircase, wainscoting and a coffered ceiling. Spanning from this grand entry is an elegant fireside living room lined in dimensional trim. Richly-toned mahogany lines the walls and coffered ceiling of a library centered by a stone fireplace. Bordered Brazilian cherry floors, wainscoting, arched doorways and a custom-painted oval tray ceiling are featured in the dining room. The adjacent butler's pantry with two walls of cabinetry and a sink links to a welcoming kitchen.

Truly an epicurean space, the center island kitchen has upper-end stainless steel appliances, granite counters and a fully windowed dining area overlooking the stone wall accented rear yard.  A dramatic two-story great room steps down from the kitchen and features a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace, detailed coffered ceiling, custom media center, railed overlook, contemporary chandelier and glass doors to the entertainment-friendly deck. Completing the main level is a guest bedroom suite connecting to a private full bath, a mudroom, a powder room, rear staircase and garage access. 

Upstairs, the primary suite begins in the lavish bedroom filled with natural light from a cupola above, while the fireplace, circle window and bordered hardwood floors are premier design elements. Dual room-sized walk-in closets are fitted with extensive wardrobe organizers. The primary sitting room takes in compelling views from a private deck. In the primary bath, a jetted tub, two sink vanities, a makeup vanity and steam shower lend a spa-like feeling. Three more en suite bedrooms are also on the second level. The third floor has bonus spaces for remote work or school, media use, or for a yoga or artist studio. 

Casual get-togethers are easily hosted in the finished lower level containing a recreation room with a fully-equipped bar, billiards area, exercise space, office, powder room and storage. Originally built in 2008 and updated more recently, this unparalleled property sits on a quiet country road yet New York City and Newark Liberty International Airport are within approximately 50 miles.","FOR_SALE","40.670216","7377","-74.80786","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/466f2d01c4603352b7c6f6ded8a8e5fa-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ccc9dd1f1e041a723093e21ec3d67c9b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6e627a7806e2f1f213810d802705f6b4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/aa1c26448b49a141612548827b1d13dc-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1dc3879ef31484c5d4d43c09c19ad3f2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b5825a63a2ee960bb193e8d67c533fe4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/de3ce38e52bde9a6859a95a4e9eca188-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/02653ca40cca7763f22d2de5c80011c0-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f35fe82e9565947fe2754543fcc3f66d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/787a979a269e2d0c81dc1631d4b57ebc-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0a4e5ee85b6470458dd4df9f26f711f2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b844e9c19ceb2b8a2d9eca8591c68e3f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8efd3ee10b1af9e98bcb1f71ddbc53dd-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c3db6ee6297d76c6d4cd8ea9641cadbf-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6b5518c0ea8ce2ec9922380fefa2703b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9935dd0197940194c932ac6bb578398e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5d15d09830228ed7ba123f81019067c1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/10af4935ab40d5885665175e3769cc65-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/49562445f5e8de8848dd9075f4f72aea-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8bbcb259e0e193cafdf3acf10f1f69fc-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/823d2ff05b08993cfd31765dc15d94c8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4c3735534b68157f3c15768728f7f3e6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2ef395d5c02d5beaeb0b7ec767e6c2ee-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1e8a28356b674dcb604b4ec4786d1acb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7cb0006c6d175b0a7e60899656a4b4a8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/63b316d6c901e5a4afefec1936ece6e2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c8b6ceac2eaf70a9d5f657610f349d77-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/83f439779ca4be8f1d53b96d7d3a91f4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/622d7f6195852be4d0a996d92ba8cc94-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/40197c38c1dcf7f04895076914ea89ab-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8119e6b617b70427557e6fac35da5dfd-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c2271250865348755cdb48d814474ad3-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b54906f71d7bf52ea75c1e7bf4157e2f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a41a38a3067d33a89d831f5b6bb88967-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/29c28893bb4f24bf9c84d0b67935c5e3-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/518eff708571a6cbb8840d1ec7918f17-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f40d3d4bd08177bef1432c93f5a64b24-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1c47316848b0eaf8e69fe8baf313ab2b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/516a4f6a9940572a3de9e3f6c839808c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4ac8aac5e81f29ec75934d689f146dbd-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c43bbb80e3ac108c383552f5d1c91520-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/caaa37a22be0d566fec129656f0faa9b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/291434e69fc67777c64f889355be6fcb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1335146f11b4d279881586d061211a44-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a3a7d386c119d5b1858ebce5e404cd7c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c8f2fca0c60b4b876180f6677d01edae-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8e26aa453e0a1bb8a7e226a0ecb2a892-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9741910c46b29286fb1ec4b9fadfa67e-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1950000","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/56-Bissell-Rd-Tewksbury-Township-NJ-08833/201789027_zpid/","2008"

"Chester Twp",,,"NJ","770 Pottersville Rd",,"07931","10","6","USD","Kestrel Ridge: A home of extraordinary quality and space sits very privately on a hillside outside of the village of Pottersville in Chester Township, enjoying the passive recreation benefits of neighboring Hacklebarney Park. A gated entry way leads to a courtyard edged by a waterfall and maturely landscaped grounds that are entirely fenced. The meticulously crafted stone exterior and handsome hand-carved wood features inside lend a European hunting manor style to the home. Architectural blueprints show over 11,000 square feet of space on three levels. Throughout the interior, expansive rooms with high ceilings are brightened with walls of windows providing views of the private grounds and hillsides beyond.

An impressive two-story entry hall opens to an equally inspiring great room with a baronial stone fireplace. Overlooking each of these rooms, and accessed by a gracious staircase, is a significant landing with domed ceiling crowning the entry area. Occupying one entire end of the first floor, the primary bedroom suite includes a sitting room/office; bedroom with fireplace; exercise room; spacious double closet rooms and double full baths with etched glass shower doors. A library/office nearby is highlighted by a stone fireplace wall. The dining room and kitchen with double islands are designed for entertaining on a generous scale with amenities for a master chef. An adjoining octagonal breakfast room with fireplace overlooks and adjoins the sprawling stone terrace spanning the back of the home, providing endless space to dine al fresco. Off the kitchen hall, a comfortable den with fireplace is the perfect place to relax.

The second floor is dedicated to three individually-designed secondary bedrooms, two with fireplaces and all with en suite baths. A laundry on this level is matched by the main laundry on the first floor. Off the back stairs a charming three-room apartment was custom-designed to provide notably comfortable space and independent living accommodations.

A spectacular lower level is largely dedicated to entertainment and recreation with an award-winning 22-seat home theater; beguiling woodland-themed bar area; a family/media room with fireplace; and a game room. Behind beautifully carved wooden doors, a wine cellar stands ready for memorable gatherings.

"Tewksbury Township",,,"NJ","3 Potter Ln",,"08833","8","6","USD","Custom-Built French Country Home at Shallow Brook Estates in Tewksbury

Situated on over three acres in the picturesque Mountainville section of Tewksbury, a custom French Country home is a distinctive presence in the Hunterdon Hills. Set far back from the road and accessed by a circular drive lined in boxwoods, the graceful stone and stucco architecture is capped by a wood shingle roof. Inside, a flowing 17-room floor plan offering six bedrooms, seven full baths and a powder room measures 6,649 square-feet, with 2,189 square-feet of additional finished living space in the walkout lower level. Storage needs are easily met in the attached three-car garage adjoining a roomy parking court.

The peaceful surroundings include a resort-style heated gunite pool and spa, a stone-walled terrace with built-in grill and bar seating, a pergola shading a bluestone patio, entertainment-friendly fire pit area, plus covered and open porches, all overlooking formal landscapes and green lawns. This residence's prime cul de sac location affords an extra measure of privacy in Shallow Brook Estates, one of the region's most notable luxury home enclaves. 

Highlights of the sun-filled layout included random width oak hardwood floors, detailed millwork, five masonry fireplaces, floor-to-ceiling windows framing pastoral views, French doors, high ceilings, custom lighting, plantation shutters, a wet bar and generously-sized rooms. 

Introducing the home is a customized double door revealing the two-story foyer, where a curving staircase is edged in ornate custom-made iron railings. Leading from the foyer is a formal dining room fitted with a huge picture window and dimensional moldings. In the step-down living room, a fireplace, coffered ceiling and sets of French doors to the terrace or library are featured. The library has handsome built-in bookcases, classic crown moldings and wainscoting. 

Wonderfully updated, the chef's kitchen contains commercial-grade stainless steel appliances from Viking, Miele and Sub-Zero, a center island with breakfast bar seating, marble countertops, custom dark wood cabinetry and a built-in espresso station. Connected to the kitchen is a butler's pantry offering marble counters, a bar sink, Viking ice maker and Viking wine cooler. The breakfast room's focal point is a stone wall gas fireplace, while French doors to the patio, a rear staircase and window wall are further amenities. 

Continuing the open flow is a spectacular two-story great room featuring beamed cathedral ceilings, a raised-hearth floor-to-ceiling fieldstone fireplace, arched windows and French doors to the patio or covered rear porch. Natural light streams into the beamed ceiling atrium from two window walls and French doors accessing the outside. A thoughtful first floor guest bedroom suite with a private full bath, plus laundry and powder rooms, complete this level.

Upstairs, the primary suite of rooms begins in an expansive bedroom warmed by the glow of a masonry fireplace and featuring a walk-in closet and elegant crown moldings. The primary sitting room or office is spacious and has plantation shutters. In the spa-inspired primary bath, marble floors, a marble shower enclosed by clear glass doors, a jetted platform tub and dual sink vanities are gracious touches. Four additional en suite bedrooms, one with a private sitting room, each adjoin a designer full bath. Finishing this level is a welcome gathering room that's ideal for movie or game nights, plus a second laundry room. 

The full, finished walkout lower level is arranged with a fireside recreation room, inviting built-in bar room, billiards room, media room, windowed exercise room, sauna, full bath and storage room. Serving this home are multiple zones of forced hot air propane heat, central air conditioning, a built-in 21K generator, a six-bedroom septic installed in 2019, central vacuum, security system, stereo system, outdoor sprinkler system, private septic, well water and underground utilities. 

Tewksbury Township is celebrated for its rolling landscapes, charming small villages and relaxed lifestyle. The township is close to Interstate 78 for commuters and offers incredible recreational opportunities for hiking, horseback riding, cycling and fishing in local parkland and nature preserves.","FOR_SALE","40.691296","8838","-74.824684","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5a1810481cb8d297f4d277fa290de7bd-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9159423923f94676f05b610b5ca41737-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8ea95592ab23a11e91f4ea6146e6c9e2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/86d693e0f8ec89c40db72112303c8602-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/009a318cf6f10190c0e6728883d812e5-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2a75350d35727fe3c3a325ec4da31867-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1ef984bc3fb2df78718a72043e644216-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e92e4b28fcfdc0f59a76bc8c5f0387eb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/36c041365120cdb45218469f38e4424d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4e5de6ba0e1a0df03f6f41c6b8d2f658-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/871d8f5a67af88bf4d417d749bd6e778-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/756b18c33441a5faed18b367d9ab6fbf-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c8a06a3212a3e95e773bd381a053b9c1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/33ab6cf7418bc205387d433578cb2aeb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/32cd880df9d93cf08e81417e27e2fd5b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1ba02d54d729d426abee6643d8c02ae6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/97c7c67d39be80e47f85251015feeaa1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/db7e7ef85bd2b9c70281693df99c144b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/57b4a5a0573adb20629b73c969ad98ef-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/042d14baf5fb60c219d98e82ea1c3cff-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/fc5893c8f57aa1e334950e5cd4657d39-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/dd6660fbc6671a4569b03fc612e244d7-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/097fdde04bb6d3b7f7c66082ec8a7287-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d54af52ddedc6dcc7723f078293d6943-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/354dbe91ab8c08815525ee7fbd96db1c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/79faddd23fbedaef8164fd6fa8010834-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/311477fef50440f534f022fc4366b649-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/31efcf5b06be645e448e4dde250197f7-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b273c38b239971fb7a74b5059f9bad08-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1aa4b5bd3cf504a531041ee330ecbc11-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/312270b041a3a119ecb7cf492fb4dbff-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/94226dbc0e4409a2629e7f9c63b37101-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/39e8ff388ace41b4eb329e97edfb486a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/baae4f7f4b9c3a1d7a7f0cfdcb82700b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/10627b4c7f4f8b093def8c7a9e208c96-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4081eb5648dcf042ae8f70d3f1350881-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7a6a7865646f71bc1ae3bc481240479d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8dfbbf66fbedb71b87711f70d99a4b03-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/37aea8e17edcdc742e21e976b2280e89-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e5790a93a7de0de8fc33304afd64f676-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e79cc153bb8db0b5c8f7b454a679078a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/627b4c5d16d0d5f6416401435f1c0280-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cc06fc1b4292b3380e8cad2b69025cfc-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/37ab96559a67f6a618665fd06309f73d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/19474d8b3f0df18b100391eec4fe6399-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/70a751232bc4973074a5ea1dddd2fabd-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d2bd281ba4feb37653c547da51d252be-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f46090adc7e122d829da65e8b98efaa7-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ab11cfa098b1986b74c44c16443e4389-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/65f6c934c8f26a40cc5d249a45c21ad5-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2d3b7a5336642b1f3751e859ce1521f2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/898f4cb6593fa120edd17003c138f12c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d4276c58416178547252a8d6c2a17abd-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6671663f0ecaf8bf038ed376860bfb03-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5f9bc04e57cf22ce374c8aff564d2f37-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e991e2d1c8699ff7b1c8e5c86380889c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1388583aec79c17f24cf33d9f1608242-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/335d29843cf05a721ce562060f21b49d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/47c0ea1242f0426f5e8ff17472aa85b8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6a34ef5e00b36046c7fd7a8418f6d8ce-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/239196dd271a10d164db8d703ab146f3-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2149000","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3-Potter-Ln-Tewksbury-Township-NJ-08833/61867805_zpid/","2002"
