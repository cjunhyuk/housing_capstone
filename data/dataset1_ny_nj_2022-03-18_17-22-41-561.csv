The laundry is also on this level, only adding to the convenience of this property. The third floor consists of two additional bedrooms, and a full bathroom (with tub). The tile work in all three full bathrooms is fairly new.  Of course parking is always a concern...not here! This home consists of an attached garage, along with driveway parking!

Meticulously rehabbed house with 4 bedrooms and 1.5 baths up the street from the Gloucester City Swim Club.  Just a stones throw from the Walt Whitman Bridge and Philadelphia, this is an affordable home with lots of great features and benefits.

Walk through the front door to a beautiful sunroom with 10 new windows and a new ceiling fan.  Then you enter the very large living room with incredible original 100 year old refinished hardwood floors with the dark wood  inlay and a brick front fireplace.  There is a dining room that is open to the totally new kitchen with all new 36” white shaker cabinets, new stainless steel 4 piece appliance package, plus a new sink, disposal, and granite countertops with a custom tiled backsplash!  There is also a full basement with a laundry area and a bonus workroom for the handyman in the family.   On the second floor are 3 bedrooms and an updated checkerboard bathroom.

With three sprawling terraces, a DEEDED PARKING SPOT AND STORAGE, you will dwell well here.

This fantastic penthouse condo offers the perfect home for entertaining or privacy. Enter the open plan living and dining space flanked by oversized windows and terraces on each side. The sun streams in all day long. Along the Southern view terrace is a dining area and a beautiful chef's kitchen with black granite counters, stainless steel appliances, breakfast bar, glass-tile backsplash and tons of cabinetry. The Samsung side-by-side refrigerator/freezer is brand new. Throughout this space is thoughtful recessed lighting as well as lovely glass pendants complimenting the kitchen decor.

That said, what you'll really enjoy is a private dedicated terrace for morning coffees or yoga! The en-suite spa bathroom has Carerra marble and porcelain tiles with a double glass front shower, generous storage and a built-in medicine cabinet. The second bedroom faces the 3rd terrace and is currently set up for work-at-home with a custom wood built-in desk, cabinetry and shelves as well as a queen-sized murphy bed - flexible for all needs - and an en-suite bathroom with tub.

"Princeton",,,"NJ","18 Katies Pond Rd",,"08540","8","7","USD","The Rushbrook enclave is known for spacious homes of distinction and this tudor-style residence, clad in stone, is perhaps the most picturesque of them all. Perched on a wide lot just shy of 3.5 acres, it is wrapped in woodsy privacy on three sides. Renowned Barsky Builders, skilled at creating custom spaces that make entertaining easier and everyday life a bit more indulgent, did not hold back on architectural features. A corbeled archway in the foyer and a recessed oval ceiling in the dining room make a striking impression, but such details are not just for formal rooms. The open Great room off the gourmet kitchen awes with a rounded two-story window and a paneled wall to match. While a sunroom lined with French doors and fanlights sparkles with light, the adjacent library's rich wood paneling and coffered ceiling are completely enveloping. Seven bedrooms all have custom closets, including the decadent master with double sided dressing room. On the lower level, a gym with sauna, home theater, and wine cellar radiate from an open party room.","FOR_SALE","40.362415","0","-74.70532","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2f6bf5f15600065f618d510f5cba6a70-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1fcbf851ee98382bce6d30044d1176c2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/eb1023bc9b97d1408d5e67dd529ca251-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a347bf7b3a3921c94c0b028d080d1bfc-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7b94433a57f09be2c3e26286e37dcc71-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5c49f7b10e4a5340bcf0e011cce5931b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/eab7898d1e57002b6f878eb51b1c79ba-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/afd8f16cc8b3d9934b4e45e05fef2435-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a58ebed537ce5a86a9c6dbf6d279d444-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4a64f0e93110edff2e98a28c53b511d2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2f04cc76a7cb0b45c8bb6235a3456c9d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6189bd5ebd4834dcf68c188ae9bbf4a8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/918439a6821c1dd2795dde3279443516-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a48e71baafd8e2858a7600c78cb07b1c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ab83b3cf477b76370bbb68d189d74778-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c70115c3cf5cb607ea918b22d05689d1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c31c069d53e96efdb201b204a91f2ec3-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/694f576d73c548c0dd596738ead95b16-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c8dd2997602c026adc4c96e83c4b8529-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ec951b24a54c840e635fb38dccca39bb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/aebbe6bf954ea5868b1ccc7f9aed5ab2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e4d1e490612db29c55fb6e09ed76755b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0d3f139215fdf371b832b48fb35a8979-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/07bb3eb50710a3e41464073d47376f0b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1f5a3fb44ebd61191fec30b510784503-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ace19494190c20cc7539f8c74975d409-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3e9590da45af46d8bebc92c07336c491-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d9011739d4267b17e8015ab34dcdd3e7-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d42bac15c2a686a244395e053c6a7810-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/99186189c826890eda9af73b9344f118-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/459960e686c982f72aecd9f449b830b0-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5da82e6368a9c43e8b6f93f663df27e3-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8b6f91a221a178a08b5e8d3904b506c3-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/fc6d40a0d86317f6559d73b4ef1e9316-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2cd38f2658567a99420e49010fc072a3-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3850000","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/18-Katies-Pond-Rd-Princeton-NJ-08540/68298903_zpid/","2005"

"Princeton",,,"NJ","11 Cleveland Ln",,"08540","6","5","USD","People passing through the Western Section take notice of this fine Colonial, not for its imposing size, but for its pleasing symmetry and gracious boxwood-lined lawn. Should any be lucky enough to step inside, they would be stunned to discover an interior just as spacious as any neighboring home with every detail, from doorknobs to bathtubs, painstakingly restored or carefully sourced to complement the original 1915 residence. A two-phase project with architect T. Jeffrey Clarke at the helm breathed new life into the original house, then vastly expanded the footprint out the back with the quality of Shulte Restorations work on full display. Uncommon nine-over-one windows were stripped and restored to smooth working order and then custom matched in the rear wing. Amish-crafted tiger maple cabinetry was finished on-site for a flawless fit in the mudroom, laundry room and, of course, the kitchen, which pulls everyone together like a magnet. Perhaps it’s the steady warmth of the massive range, just one of several imported Aga appliances, or the leathered granite island big enough to spread out the most abundant buffet. A family room wrapped in shiplap and a covered porch past a Dutch door offer casual spots to unwind, while the living room is decidedly more formal with Williamsburg-inspired paneling around a working fireplace. Five bedrooms have distinct amenities, such as dressing alcoves, that lend character and functionality, but none is as resplendent as the main suite with a remarkably airy bathroom with featured soaking tub. The finished, walk-out basement keeps games and rowdy fun as far as possible from the top floor study, a work-from-home sanctuary. This meticulously executed labor of love was a featured stop on The Historical Society of Princeton’s famous house tour. All of this sits perfectly positioned with Nassau Street just 4/10 of a mile away…come see!","FOR_SALE","40.352528","0","-74.66879","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a0e19a698ce856ee5dcce6e051bd485c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/61cc0ac4c0de942946e5387026849858-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0b2c97a3ae89175136f05bba88380ff6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e22943da6785af5281fc45e924295969-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c6b77f3f2212e78354d780792aa4d523-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2c6ce13666d7bad6e92ca221dcd65006-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5a89b82b845b5b27f254e3b5717ffb46-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/48ca1cfa7d10f91dbb6ebd314d068fc3-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/942d30183a2c6ba8d3a7dc308696d493-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2d13495698b3bbaf6458799492e17807-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c8a3a64de06a75d5cb5ff9a044d064e8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6d2baab4bfe1deb9eb9815fc17666793-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8d8d7323fdd8fea2e25d593ec78da9a6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4500b4fa3cd96d4c0f58ebf2a2968e3d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f8f9ade1dc715bb6b7c720acb246b73c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d245731eab825af3c19c5942c5e26f70-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/91c5245cf26eb5ac0d898cebfd85f686-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/88df866180f0b700e42ee04947a5baeb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/348012858c1028648455059cbf911f1f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1338c0e754254b43e569c6fc408166b6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e62ccbaaf8fd92dec5e003687f8092cc-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5c976c73a535b42a16acebee30d74dd9-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d7f5d70fbe2c691b7ae619e7f4cf319b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6b958ed904be97c5fe77ea3896cbc807-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ebfd3f5414e9a19ca085e78479affc3a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4c23f6879a0350bca0cb864ec65f6511-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/17ed8f58eb66d2a7664df75bfcb40d36-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b1b6925f6371675f612eb57136e1c5ab-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6193fb523292c76dd2e0ac4b284c57f8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/645877a77f797896d4d56301c5412a08-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c87c269c99806cb603f88d8c5af223b6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9daf5154ca3fefd3b95f2a777f04730d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ecbf86d7d026e3832956232f449ea088-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/819af88fd318200d3122ac31810e741f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b1b33ec37a5bbbd5bfd241d4ca66648f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e201a2292c79528a49102caed05a9c7b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4c34116fb123c3a32e9aacb4f6f03bb6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/68f5531b260ffbd842c1e730204513b3-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/505c8031e8b203c27af867795ec78fc0-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c4a5fade916c8cbcad571cc02b6be0aa-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cda4a9e0966da6be033440f0886d99a1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2cfb80747125c67eb06d763bbb263de0-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0acf3b24954f7cedf167183c6443dc27-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/915d7048c40e96d0af5c14dbe941159f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/a424432b37391407f97da98f3f5f5d4b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3ebc76aca8a794a864af8105135f5ad9-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d07d8735aff26571d87ef01b1a4b0170-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1f84e3b90ddd2aaee7a98141008fd14d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/75e216765b59e7702c53ae0583d79387-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4f4bac793ed1bd64b81d33e066f37528-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2275000","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/11-Cleveland-Ln-Princeton-NJ-08540/39007425_zpid/","1915"

"Brooklyn",,,"NY","381 Mayfair Dr S",,"11234","4","4","USD","Welcome to this charming split level colonial in Brooklyn's prestigious Mill Basin. This split level colonial has undergone multiple renovations over the years. It begins with the fully gated exterior, featuring a brick and stucco facade, along with a completely paved front and rear yard, as well as  a private deck off of the back of the house.  Upon entry, you will find a formal living room and dining room with an updated eat in kitchen.

"Sea Isle City",,,"NJ","2401 Landis Ave",,"08243","5","4","USD","Beautiful beachfront located on the now immensely popular ""morning glory/evening splendor"" coastline section of Sea Isle City. This stretch of beachfront homes is unique to the entire Cape May County coast. Homes at this location enjoy both morning sunrises directly over the Atlantic and unobstructed evening sunsets over the bay and its wildlife-filled wetlands. Some of the finest Sea Isle beachfront townhomes have been developed here in recent years to take advantage of those views and the resulting less crowded stretches of beaches found here. This is your opportunity to secure your place along this exclusive stretch of beachfront homes. The townhouse features true hardwood floors, a contemporary styled kitchen with carpenter-crafted cabinetry, extended granite counter space including a long center island, carpenter built-in benches with storage in the sunny great room, and fine finishes throughout. A large garage area with storage space on the ground floor also contains the entrance to the elevator which accesses every floor of the residence. The first floor features three bedrooms, each with their own ensuite access to separate bathrooms. The architectural design of this home incorporated the full ocean-sunrise-bay-sunset potential with a long living area extending the full length of the second floor. The space from the entertainment area on the beachside through the centrally located kitchen to the dining area on the bayside is one open area. However, the current owners ingeniously added a sliding barn door so that a dining area can also be cordoned off as its own space. To this ""bay room"" they added a built-in bench-and-storage on one wall flanked opposite by a granite counter wet bar with built-in refrigeration. The result offers an intimate space for dining or evening cocktails when the mood is right. A small deck on the bay side off this room is the perfect retreat for a guests to step away from the inside crowd to enjoy a magic sunset. Finally, this home offers an owners' bedroom that's a rare Sea Isle townhouse find. Instead of maximizing for number of bedrooms, the design of this home does not short-change the owner bedroom and instead dedicates the entire third floor to private quarters. A sunset deck in the rear is off a space the current owners utilized as an office, but would also be great as an exercise area, closet storage, yoga or meditation area, or additional media area. A large bathroom with a walk-in shower divides that section from the bedroom area. The bed side offers views of the ocean from both beachside windows and a sliding-glass door to a crow-perch on the southern corner of the home. This is a wonderfully well-built townhome on one of the most magnificent stretches of shoreline in NJ. It's ideally located where beaches are less crowded with fantastic views of both the ocean and the bay that can rarely be found simultaneously in the same home. The buyer looking for a special place in Sea Isle will not be disappointed.","FOR_SALE","39.166832","2457","-74.68251","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b64c31d33bfca61663e1836511a59a21-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9e719fe006ebaa615730cfab88e5bafc-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cdbe90ca192a35a7a6bfe3cf3c7657e8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/013b7da22557970f9b5b11af3138ee00-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/94ecf4793a231217e5b42f8d6caaa2c1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c59e88aaa0e97854a93c5fc3591d100e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cd8763eee638ab7838a680d86d87c5c7-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/97eb02497a89a4158d29bb95af05bfb8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4b5e179bd8b2bac7ceca86fa63e34ffb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/973a15e08540c51e81debbb1caad40cd-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/fdf3545901b02b6b7495bb4ec1f2ba82-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d1d648870c72820972f8cd8ffd175499-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2c73301c4db67ac594b453324cf99d6f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5ea2c9de18382c7ecb6b57d387594ba8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/39a0a51a7448c4459c5e2ae06f732ea4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/872933ec82d0474dc978dc7b92806eda-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/eb8c7bace443141340c0a00872bfee90-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/df4b86ceb23bcf4a249e3750a232a8ae-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/326f1ed52a0042df21d4604db4a78a54-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/245134b4d211db6b90f5dbe208d85007-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9023e20b257316fd61f31f50b25b5491-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6cb36ec608c3a6897a8ab390bd0ac560-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c8c134fcf6786d2e8a6c87a7d2b75dfa-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d8f6578bd71d4ec347de44d2f1b9d395-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/aaa0859ad9f0db1a9dd1de6c858ddcd6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/788c7c48f283cc9fde12116107ebaf59-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/023370344a4259da9e539c4f732c3d51-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d08189c75c7add488530e36fd6ff7b45-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c34f90d506855b59548b8d419fc9b8c7-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f1b290ff89ab4f9777d21cd7d8a65a51-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d7ec1206cd8a67966de23ab386a8cbb1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7ed9d769d103655a0fa26ed0daa9c623-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f160680a83b267628ad10040cbb3c2da-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5f51f3ceeeea171aedaba040ac398174-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b7835541d0c72ee17952d718e274f184-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6b61b0299cc5b1a8f69afed810c8d04e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/64154eb772a29909a25820cbfd0e2b71-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e37343c55b6398c2e348bd8339fb7549-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/17e32adcf333f3b3086546688c61ad77-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1c698b514dbdca2b4c1592d6b21c29b8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1c538302c0efdf3baa10eb410c5a1df2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b64c31d33bfca61663e1836511a59a21-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2999000","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2401-Landis-Ave-Sea-Isle-City-NJ-08243/114427634_zpid/","2010"
